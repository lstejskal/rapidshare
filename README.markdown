# Rapidshare

## Description

This gem provides a wrapper for RapidShare API.

Full documentation of RapidShare API is available at
[http://images.rapidshare.com/apidoc.txt](http://images.rapidshare.com/apidoc.txt)

## Installation

```ruby
gem install rapidshare
```

## Usage

This example shows a simple script which downloads files from Rapidshare:

```ruby
require 'rubygems'
require 'rapidshare'

files_to_download = %w{
  https://rapidshare.com/files/829628035/HornyRhinos.jpg
  https://rapidshare.com/files/3103991314/HappyHippos.jpg
  https://rapidshare.com/files/3882189288/ElegantElephants.jpg
}

rs = Rapidshare::API.new(:login => 'my_login', :password => 'my_password')

files_to_download.each do |file|
  result = rs.download(file)

  unless result.downloaded? 
    puts "[#{file}] cannot be downloaded: #{result.error}"
  end
end
```

## Login

Rapidshare gem is meant to be used mostly by premium users. In order to call Rapidshare
services as premium user, you need to log in first, using your login and password.

```ruby
rs = Rapidshare::API.new(:login => 'my_login', :password => 'my_password')
```

Alternatively you can use *cookie* parameter, which stores encrypted login and
password parameters.

```ruby
rs = Rapidshare::API.new(:cookie => 'my_cookie')
```

Best practice is to use cookie. You probably don't want to enter your Rapidshare
password every time or have it stored in some config file on your hard drive. 

### How to get Rapidshare cookie

```ruby
Rapidshare::API.new(:login => 'my_login', :password => 'my_password').cookie
```

## Rapidshare Services

### Get Account Details

```ruby
rs.get_account_details
```

### Check Files

```ruby
rs.check_files(
  'https://rapidshare.com/files/829628035/HornyRhinos.jpg',
  'https://rapidshare.com/files/428232373/HappyHippos.jpg',
  'https://rapidshare.com/files/766059293/ElegantElephants.jpg'
)
```

### Download File

```ruby
rs.download('https://rapidshare.com/files/829628035/HornyRhinos.jpg')
```

**Download workflow:** file is checked by `API#check_files` method first. If it
can be downloaded, progress bar is shown for download and afterwards `API`
instance is returned with `downloaded` attribute set to *true*. If the file is
invalid, `API` instance is returned with `downloaded` attribute set to (wait for
it) *false*. (`downloaded` attribute is also accessible by `downloaded?`
method.)

## Service Calls

All calls to Rapidshare services are done internally by `API#request` method:

Syntax:

```ruby
request(service_name, params_in_hash)
```

Example:

```ruby
Rapidshare::API.request(:getaccountdetails, :login => 'my_login', :password => 'my_password')
```

Use this method to call Rapidshare services which don't have dedicated methods
available.

### Parser Parameter

`API#request` method has an optional parameter *:parser* which specifies how to 
parse the response from Rapidshare. (Rapidshare doesn't unified API, there are
several "types" of responses.) Following options are supported at the moment:

* *:none* - default, returns response body as it is
* *:csv* - parses response like CSV file into array of arrays
* *:hash* - parses response like a hash - *key=value* strings separated by newlines

Example:

```ruby
rs.request(:getaccountdetails, :parser => :hash)
```

PS: cookie is automatically added if you call request method on a `API` instance.

### Method Missing

Let's say you want to call service for which rapidshare gem doesn't have
dedicated method yet, for example: *getrapidtranslogs* . While you can
explicitly call `API#request` method:

```ruby
rs.request(:getrapidtranslogs, :parser => 'csv')
```

the cooler way is to make a service call using `API#method_missing`:

```ruby
rs.getrapidtranslogs(:parser => 'csv')
```

If you call an uknown method on `API` instance, `missing_method` assumes
that you want to make a service call to Rapidshare and invokes the `request`
method, using the missing method name as service name and passing any available
params. For example:

```ruby
rs.getrapidtranslogs(:parser => 'csv')
```

invokes

```ruby
rs.request(:getrapidtranslogs, :parser => 'csv')
```

`method_missing` also removes any underscores from the service name, so these
method calls are equivalent:

```ruby
rs.getrapidtranslogs == rs.get_rapid_trans_logs
```

PS: This is used for aliasing dedicated methods as well: `rs.get_account_details`
invokes `rs.getaccountdetails`. In this case the corresponding dedicated
method is called instead of the low-level `request` method, because we check for
existense of dedicated method first.

In [examples directory](./rapidshare/tree/master/examples/) you will other examples of using
Rapidshare gem. Among other things there are scripts which can serve as simple
download clients.
